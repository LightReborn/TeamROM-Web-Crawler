This has been an interesting project, and one in which I've learned a number of things that I've wanted to learn for some time. The UI work on the website was nothing new to me - my previous job I did front end work using MVC and Twitter Bootstrap, so there wasn't much more that I really needed to know to produce the front end of the website. It was still really cool to see it come together, and to see how different images, colors, and fonts transformed the overall image and message that the site portrayed to the user.

Also, unit testing was not new to me. My previous experience had required a substantial amount of unit testing, so I was familiar with the premise behind unit testing, as well as how to implement it. This experience proved invaluable, as it helped Greg in his endeavors towards better understanding unit testing.

The back end work was where I learned the most in this project. I have used ORMs before, but I've never had to set one up and link it to a database. Thus, integrating Entity Framework 6 into the project to get data to and from a SQL Server database was totally new to me. However, after figuring EF out I can say that is really, really cool. It may or may not be as fast as stored procedures, but it makes querying the database sooo much nicer in general. This is definitely a tool I'll use on any future .NET projects.

As Joseph mentioned, this project has been quite interesting, but in my case virtually **_everything_** about the project has been a new experience. From Markdown, to MVC, to Unit Testing, to Git, to GitHub, to Web Scraping, Entity Framework, to etc, etc, this semester was filled with learning something new.  

My primary responsibility for the project was Unit Testing, and while I did a decent job, it seems I have yet to master testing.  Thanks to Joseph, Michael, our class material, and of course Google, I do have a better understanding, however, I feel the over all testing for this project still has a little ways to go.  Perhaps the biggest challenge with testing seems to be, not only the process of writing unit tests, but the need for the tester to understand what all parts of the project are doing.  In that respect, I fell short.  Difficulties arose, not with understanding the various project concepts, but the technical implementation of testing those different components.  Prior to this project, I had a perception that testing code was a job for the 'weak link' within the organization, but I now see testing as a job that requires a well rounded, knowledgeable programmer who can and must understand all technical facits of the project at hand.
